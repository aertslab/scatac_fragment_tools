Tools for working with scATAC-seq fragment files.

## Installation

```bash
# Install scatac-fragment-tools.
pip install scatac-fragment-tools

# Install scatac-fragment-tools with "pyBigWig" support (replacement for "pybigtools").
# ("pyBigWig" is slower than "pybigtools", so "pyBigWig" is only recommended if you
# would experience issues with bigWig file creation with "pybigtools".)
pip install scatac-fragment-tools[pybigwig]
```
